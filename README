Light RSA implementation in C with the only goal of understanding
the algorithm a little better.

No big deal.

Compiling & linking:

  Building help (it's just this very help)
    $ make help

  Build the application:
    $ make all

  Clean object files:
    $ make clean-obj

  Clean object and binary files:
    $ make clean

  There is no installer and there never will be.


Build errors:

  In order to build you must make the directories `bin/'
  and `obj/' at the same level as `include/' and `src/',
  or else the compilation won't work.
